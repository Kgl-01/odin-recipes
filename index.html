        <p>This is the sequel to the God of War game released in the year 2018. Which sold 20M copies on PS4 alone and it is a PS exclusive only .</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/in/en/">Cyberpunk 2077</a></li>
        <p>This was the most hyped up game since it was developed by Witcher_3 developers cd_projekt.</p>
        <p>And also it was the big dissatrous game launch in the game industry till date. As it was full of bugs and was unplayable on base ps4 and xbox.

            The release of the game was rushed and it was half-cooked. Later on the company provided refund for the returned order. Now the game has been polished pretty good and raytracing looks good.
